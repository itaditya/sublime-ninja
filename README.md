# Sublime Ninja
Become a sublime ninja and get 100x productivity boosts.


The two killer features of sublime are the many handy keyboard shortcuts and huge number of installable plugins.

## How to work on a project-

1. Download and Install Sublime Text 3.
1. Make sure you have sublime added in env variables.
1. Always create a separate folder for each project (even if project is of two files).
1. Open command line in the project folder.
1. Type `subl .` and press `Enter`.
1. Sublime text will open.
1. The advantage is that you'll get a sidebar having names of files and folders which you can open directly from there.



## Must Use Plugins -

1. **SidebarEnhancements** - Enhance the sidebar with features like rename file, move file etc.
1. **Emmet** - Quickly generate html. Like doing `ul#list>li.list-item*10` will generate an unordered list of 10 items.
1. **Auto File Name** - Autcomplete suggestions of file paths for quickly adding files. Like an image in html file.
1. **HTML CSS Prettify** - Formats code so it is easy to read (Don't use if you use cli tools like prettier).

To install a plugin in Sublime Text 3, press `Ctrl + Shift + P` then type package control, an autosuggestion will come "Install Package Control". Click on it. Wait for it to install. Restart sublime and then press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type "Install Pacakge" then enter name of plugin like say you type "Emmet" then click on the first suggeston. Emmet will be installed. Do this for each plugin.

## Must Use Keyboard Shortcuts -

Sublime has this amazing feature of batch editing. Think of it as like Find and Replace but only for two repetitions or three repitions. This comes in handy when you want to change the classes of two p tags or change a ul tag to ol tag. This feature can be combined with other shortcuts to perform boring code editing at lighting speed.

1. `Ctrl + D` to get cursors at repetitions of selected text and then edit all together.

1. `Ctrl + Alt + Up` to get another cursor in upper line. `Ctrl + Alt + Down` to get in lower line.

Other must use editing shortcuts -

1. `Ctrl + Shift + M` to select everything between open and closing bracket pairs in css and javascript.
1. `Ctrl + Shift + A` to select everything between open and closing tags in html.
1. `Home` to go to start of line. `End` to go to end of line.
1. `Ctrl + Home` to go to start of file. `Ctrl + End` to go to end of file.
1. `Ctrl + [` to decrease indentation of selected lines by one unit. `Ctrl + ]` to increase.
