Become a sublime ninja and get 100x productivity boosts.

## How to work on a project-

1. Download and Install Sublime Text 3.
1. Make sure you have sublime added in env variables.
1. Always create a separate folder for each project (even if project is of two files).
1. Open command line in the project folder.
1. Type `subl .` and press `Enter`.
1. Sublime text will open.
1. The advantage is that you'll get a sidebar having names of files and folders which you can open directly from there.



## Must Install Plugins -

1. **SidebarEnhancements** - Enhance the sidebar with features like rename file, move file etc.
1. **Emmet** - Quickly generate html. Like doing `ul#list>li.list-item*10` will generate an unordered list of 10 items.
1. **Auto File Name** - Autcomplete suggestions of file paths for quickly adding files. Like an image in html file.
1. **HTML CSS Prettify** - Formats code so it is easy to read (Don't use if you use cli tools like prettier).

To install a plugin in Sublime Text 3, press `Ctrl + Shift + P` then type package control, an autosuggestion will come "Install Package Control". Click on it. Wait for it to install. Restart sublime and then press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type "Install Pacakge" then enter name of plugin like say you type "Emmet" then click on the first suggeston. Emmet will be installed. Do this for each plugin.
